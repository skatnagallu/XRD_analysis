    lam: This parameter controls the smoothness of the baseline. Higher values of Î» result in a smoother baseline,

    p (asymmetry parameter): This controls how asymmetrically the peaks are penalized. 
    Typically, p is set between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.01), 
    so that positive deviations (above the baseline) are penalized less than negative deviations (below the baseline),
    which forces the baseline to lie below the peaks.
    niter: Number of iterations to perform the fitting. Generally, a small number of iterations (e.g., 10) is sufficient.
